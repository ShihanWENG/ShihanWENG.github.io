<h1>Welcome to Shihan's Homepage!</h1>
I am currently a Ph.D. student in Statistics at the School of Economics and Management, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), where I expect to complete my degree in 2030.

My research interests encompass two main areas: <b>Econometric Theory</b> and <b>Applied Development Economics</b>.

On the theoretical side, I focus on applying Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to applied econometrics. Specifically, I am developing methods to estimate treatment effects at extremal quantiles by integrating EVT with modern causal inference frameworks, such as Difference-in-Differences (DiD). My work aims to provide robust tools for revealing heterogeneous treatment effects that are often overlooked in central tendency analyses.

On the applied side, I investigate the dynamics, causes, and consequences of inequality in the developing world. I have a particular interest in gender economics. My current research examines why gender gaps persist in developing countries and how they are unintentionally shaped by non-gender-targeted policies. Primarily grounded in the Chinese context, my empirical work seeks to uncover mechanisms that hold broader implications for other economies.

I am open to academic discussion and potential collaboration. Please feel free to reach out to me via [wengshihan24@mails.ucas.ac.cn](mailto:wengshihan24@mails.ucas.ac.cn) or [shineweng555@gmail.com](mailto:shineweng555@gmail.com).
